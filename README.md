# Databricks Notebooks for Facial Expression Classification

This notebook was created to allow users use Databricks notebooks when they do the Facial Expression Classification course.

## Getting Started
This lab makes use of the repo files feature in Databricks that can "access" files to support markdown in
databricks notebooks.

1. Sign up to the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/facial-expression-classification/home/welcome
2. Ensure you have WSFS_ENABLED = True in your cluster config.
3. Import the git repository as uploading will not allow images to be referenced within the notebook
4. Have fun learning.
